# My translator curriculum
GitHub profile 

I'm electronics engineer and have worked for 30 years for a Swiss-German company GRETAG AG, based in Zurich, specializing in Photography, Crypto and Cypher equipment.

I'm the webmaster of my Italian site “quanticbay.com” which I used to improve my knowledge of working on the front-end of the site, various specific file formats and on-demand using plugins like WPML or others.

I speak and write fluent English, French (mother tongue), Italian (mother tongue) and some Dutch, I also understand some German.

I use various applications such as IBM Watson, Google translate, Deepl, Reverso, Sdl Trados, Elevenlabs and a few others to speed up the translation process, although they are not always reliable, but ultimately the translation result depends on my proofreading skills.
